\section{Object-Oriented Concepts}
In the design of the application \textbf{GetClasses}, object-oriented concepts are used to structure the system into classes/objects that represent roles, operations, and data.

\subsection*{Main Entities (Classes)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Student
    \item Tutor
    \item Administrator
    \item Academic Profile
    \item Scheduling
    \item Virtual Class
    \item Payment System
    \item Chat/Message
    \item Review
\end{itemize}

\newpage
\subsection*{Main Operations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Student: register, log in, search tutors, book class, pay, leave review.
    \item Tutor: register, manage profile, accept/reject requests, teach classes, receive payments.
    \item Administrator: validate identities, solve disputes, supervise reviews and transactions.
    \item Payment System: process payments, transfers, refunds.
    \item Scheduling: show availability, reserve slots, notify users.
    \item Chat/Message: send, receive, and store messages.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Data Flows (Simplified)}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Registration/Login: Student/Tutor enters data → System validates → Access granted.
    \item Search and Booking: Student searches → selects slot → Scheduling confirms.
    \item Payment: Student pays → Payment System processes → Tutor receives balance.
    \item Virtual Class: Scheduling starts session → Virtual Class connects both.
    \item Review: Student leaves feedback → Stored in Tutor Profile.
    \item Support: Administrator intervenes in case of disputes.
\end{enumerate}

\newpage
\section{Requirements Documentation}

\section*{Notes and Reflection}
\begin{itemize}
    \item All documentation is in English.
    \item References should be cited if external resources were used.
    \item This is a draft, subject to improvement in future workshops.
\end{itemize}

\bigskip
\noindent
\textbf{Reflection:}  
During this first stage, the main challenge was defining clear user interactions and ensuring the platform covered both tutor and student needs. Decisions were made to prioritize usability, security, and scalability for future growth.
